L. 117–43), approved September 30, \n2021 (the ‘‘Appropriations Act’’), makes available $5,000,000,000 in Community Development Block \nGrant Disaster Recovery (CDBG–DR) funds nationwide. These CDBG–DR funds are disbursed among \nthe “most impacted and distressed” (MID) areas across the country for necessary expenses for \nactivities authorized under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n5301 et seq.) (HCDA) related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of infrastructure and \nhousing, economic revitalization, and mitigation resulting from a qualifying major disaster in 2020 or \n2021. Under the Appropriations Act approved in September 2021, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development (HUD) has allocated approximately $2.3 billion in CDBG–DR funds to the state of \nLouisiana for ongoing recovery efforts. \nThe Louisiana Office of Community Development (OCD) has allocated these CDBG-DR funds to \nvarious programs as described in the State of Louisiana Action Plan for the Utilization of Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Funds in Response to 2020 and 2021 Federal Declarations in Louisiana, as \namended. OCD’s objective in allocating these funds is to ensure that all CDBG-DR dollars provided to \nthe state are fully utilized, to the greatest extent possible, to address the unmet needs from the covered \n2020-2021 disasters. The specifics of Hurricanes Laura, Delta, Ida and the May 2021 Severe Storms \nare provided in 87 FR 6364, dated February 3, 2022 (Hurricanes Laura and Delta), and 87 FR 31636, \ndated May 24, 2022 (Hurricane Ida and the May 2021 Severe Storms).  \nOCD works in close collaboration with other federal and state agencies engaged in disaster recovery to \nsupport rebuilding and recovery actions in the state of Louisiana. It functions to coordinate and provide \nfunding to local governments and public entities in storm-damaged parishes and municipalities. Critical \nto this function is OCD’s collaboration with local and community leaders to respond to their \ncommunities’ most urgent rebuilding needs and assist in identifying long-term and innovative solutions \nto strengthen the state’s infrastructure and critical systems. \nThis manual details the policies of the Resilient Communities Infrastructure Program (RCIP). The \nmanual’s intended audience is the interested public, program subrecipients, and OCD staff. \nTo meet HUD disaster recovery objectives, OCD has specifically designed the RCIP to assist impacted \ncommunities in recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Laura, Delta, Ida and the May 2021 \nSevere Storms. \nThe RCIP is designed to address the unmet needs for infrastructure recovery located in identified MID \nareas impacted by the 2020-2021 storms. Documentation of impacts from the disasters will be required \nto be considered eligible for assistance. \nThe Disaster Recovery CDBG Grantee Administrative Manual provides in-depth information on \nimplementing the procedures associated with the policies outlined in this manual.

COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOR AGREEMENT (CEA)  \nOCD will first work with the subrecipient to execute a cooperative endeavor agreement (CEA). The \nCEA serves as the mechanism for the transfer of funds to the subrecipient, and requires compliance \nwith all federal, state and local laws, as applicable. \nThe assigned OCD staff member will work directly with the subrecipient to collect information needed to \ncomplete the CEA process.  \nB.  RECOVERY PROPOSAL \nFollowing the execution of the CEA, the subrecipient will be able to submit the Recovery Proposal. \nOCD must review and approve the submitted proposal before the subrecipient may begin implementing \nprojects to be funded under the RCIP. (See Exhibit E-2, “Resilient Communities Infrastructure Program\nRecovery Proposal.”) \nThe purpose of the Recovery Proposal is to justify the recovery needs that will be met through the \nproposed program. It functions to provide OCD with a clear understanding of the disaster impact on \neach community and how the projects to be implemented under the RCIP address these identified \nimpacts. \nAfter the Recovery Proposal is approved, the subrecipient is required to submit a separate application \nform for each respective project proposed by the recipient.  \ni) \nDEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION  \nThe deadline for submission of the RCIP Recovery Proposal to OCD is three (3) months from the \ndate the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement (CEA) is executed by OCD.  \nii) \nPROCESS FOR SUBMISSION  \nThe subrecipient will be required to submit the RCIP Recovery Proposal through the OCD online IGX \nSystem. OCD assigned staff will assist the subrecipient in completing the proposal online, providing \nsupport throughout the entire process. Subrecipients may direct any questions to their respective \nassigned OCD staff member, or by submitting questions to OCD.Infrastructure@la.gov.  \niii)  CITIZEN PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS  \nHUD requires citizen participation prior to expending CDBG-DR funds.

Parishes and municipalities are required to conduct at least one (1) public \nmeeting in the development of their Recovery Proposal. \nPublic notice of the meeting must be 5 to 21 days prior to the date of the meeting. It is important to \nnote— efforts and methods used in soliciting participation of persons of low- and moderate-\nincome (LMI) and residents of a Disadvantaged Community as defined by the U.S. Department \nof Transportation in the public participation process are to be documented in the Recovery \nProposal. This is in addition to other public participation documentation required. \niv)  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS  \nUnits of local governments identified in the above allocations will apply for funds using the process \nstipulated in this manual and defined in the Substantial Action Plan Amendment No. 1.  \nFor purposes of a Recovery Proposal, the following documents must be attached.  \nA.  Fully Executed Resilient Communities Infrastructure Program Recovery Proposal (see E-2, \nRecovery Proposal Template). \nB.  A copy of the resolution authorizing the submission of the Recovery Proposal by the \nparish/municipal governing authority. \nC.  Copy of all citizen participation documents as noted in the Recovery Proposal Template (see E-2 \nRecovery Proposal Template). \nAdditional documents will be required at appropriate times, according to HUD/CDBG requirements for \nimplementation, approval of project applications, and the drawdown of funds. \nv) \nTIMELINE OF ACTIVITIES   \nThe Recovery Proposal obligates funds under each specific project. Upon approval of the Recovery \nProposal, subrecipients will proceed with procurement of needed professional design services and the \npreparation of the environmental review record for each project. The projected timeline for projects \nfunded under RCIP is as follows: \n•  Submission of the Recovery Proposal to OCD: \nThree (3) months from the date the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement (CEA) is executed. \n•  Submission of Project Application to OCD: \nThree (3) months from the date the Recovery Proposal is approved. \n•  Submission of each Project-Specific Environmental Review Record: \nSix (6) months from the date the Project Application is approved. \n•  Submission of Final Project Plans, Specifications, and Cost Estimate (if required): \nSix (6) months from the date the Project Application is approved. \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n8 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \nProjects that fail to meet the established timeline (including extensions, if any) are subject to \ncancellation and reallocation of funds.  \nC.  PROJECT APPLICATION \nOnce the Recovery Proposal is approved by OCD, the subrecipient will be required to submit a \nseparate application for each project through the OCD online IGX System. OCD assigned staff will \nassist the subrecipient in completing the Recovery Proposal online, providing support throughout the \nentire process. At a minimum, the full application for funding requires the following information or \nsubmission: \n•  Detailed description of the project; \n•  Activity beneficiary data; \n•  Tie to the disaster; \n•  Tie to local disaster recovery plans and adopted land-use plans;  \n•  Documentation that the proposed activities are CDBG-DR eligible; \n•  Project cost estimate; \n•  Project maps; \n•  Project time schedule; \n•  Mapping of the project target area and determining project beneficiaries, in accordance with the \nprocedures contained in E-5, Procedures for Mapping Project Target Areas and Project \nBeneficiaries. \nThe subrecipient will be notified of the application approval via an IGX system email notification. A copy \nof this approval must be placed in the project file. \nD.  DOCUMENTING PROJECT CHANGES  \nChanges to projects by subrecipients are documented through an amendment to the application for \nfunding and/or an amendment to the CEA. Changes to contracts are documented through a contract \namendment and/or a change order. Subrecipients are required to confer with OCD as to the method to \nbe followed in documenting changes to an approved project. \nE.  PROJECT REQUESTS FOR PAYMENT \nSubrecipient payments are typically expended on a reimbursement-based payment process. \n“Reimbursement-based” means that project costs must be incurred by the subrecipient and \ndocumented. For reimbursement-based payments, the subrecipient must submit a request for payment \npackage to OCD for review and approval. \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n9 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \nF.  PROJECT REPORTING \nSubrecipients will be required to provide quarterly reports and attend status meetings with assigned \nstaff, as requested, throughout project implementation. \nG.  PROJECT MONITORING \nAll RCIP projects will be monitored by OCD to ensure the project is: \n•  Achieving its intended results; \n•  Protecting programs and resources from waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement; \n•  Following laws, regulations and applicable CDBG-DR policies and procedures. \nH.  PROJECT CLOSEOUT \n1.  Project closeout is the process by which OCD determines all requirements of the CEA between \nOCD and the subrecipient for a specific project have been completed in accordance with the terms \nand conditions of the CEA. Project closeout is requested by the subrecipient when: \na.  All project expenses (including non-CDBG-DR funds) to be paid have been completed and \npayment requested; \nb.  Approved work has been finished; \nc.  All responsibilities detailed in the CEA have been fulfilled; \nd.  All required documentation has been collected; and \ne.  All monitoring or audit findings have been cleared. \n2.

As outlined in \nthe policy, OCD will monitor expenditure rates and milestones to ensure projects and activities are \ncompleted within the required timeframes. \nAdditionally, OCD has established administrative requirements for subrecipients to track spending and \nproject performance. These include: \n•  Keeping all accounting records up to date. \n•  Establishing project time schedules and milestones. \n•  Developing financial projections and expenditure schedules. \n•  Tracking and recording program income. \n•  Submitting quarterly progress reports to OCD. \nOCD has designated staff to oversee program spending and routinely runs and reconcile spending \nreports utilizing the state’s accounting system and HUD’s Disaster Recovery Reporting (DRGR) \nsystem. These designated staff provide OCD senior management and program managers with monthly \nreports on program activity, expenditures, and financial projections. If a program or subrecipient is \nunder-performing, OCD will first attempt to take corrective action to increase performance.  If OCD \ndetermines the program or project will be unable to meet the HUD expenditure deadline, OCD will \nreallocate the CDBG-DR funds to another program or project. \ni) \nPROCEDURES IN DETERMINING FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR \nREALLOCATION \nOCD has established the following procedures for identifying the funds that will be available for \nreallocation (“excess funds”). \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n20 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \na) \nOCD DIRECTLY IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS   \nFor programs directly implemented by OCD, OCD will establish financial projections, timetables, \napplication deadlines, and other required milestones for each program. In general, OCD has \nestablished the following timetable for OCD directly implemented activities. \n•  All funds should be obligated by May 31, 2023. \n•  All funds should be expended by July 31, 2028. \nFunds that remain unobligated after closeout of the approved project must be re-obligated to another \npriority or alternate project by May 31, 2024, or those funds will be considered for reallocation by OCD \nto another subrecipient or to another program. Requests for exceptions will be reviewed on a project-\nby-project bases by OCD.  \nb) \nSUBRECIPI ENT IMPLEMENTED ACTIVITIES   \nIn addition to the funds to be awarded under the RCIP, OCD has created other programs to provide \nCDBG-DR funds to parishes/municipalities and other subrecipients to implement projects under the \n“Hurricanes Recovery Program.” \nCDBG-DR funds may be awarded to subrecipients for projects directly selected by OCD, projects \nselected on a competitive basis, or funds may be allocated to subrecipients for the subrecipient to \nidentify and select projects. In general, all projects implemented by subrecipients will require the \nsubrecipient to submit a project time schedule and anticipated expenditure schedule to OCD for review. \nProjects selected for funding should not only demonstrate a “tie-back” to the covered disaster but also \nreadiness to proceed in a timely manner consistent with the HUD expenditure deadline. \nSubrecipient projects directly selected by OCD or awarded on a competitive basis will be monitored for \ncompliance with the time and expenditure schedules included in the application. Upon award, OCD will \nestablish initial deadlines for completion of the environmental review record and project plans and \nspecifications. Projects that fail to meet the established deadlines (including extensions, if any) are \nsubject to cancellation and reallocation of funds.  \nProject underruns (reasonably anticipated project costs being less than the budget allocated) are \nsubject to reallocation. Steps will be taken to identify project underruns, if any, as early as possible. \nTo reiterate, the projected timeline for projects funded under the RCIP is as follows: \n•  Submission of the Recovery Proposal to OCD: \nThree (3) months from the date the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement (CEA) is executed. \n•  Submission of the Project Application to OCD: \nThree (3) months from the date the Recovery Proposal is approved. \n•  Submission of each Project-Specific Environmental Review Record: \nSix (6) months from the date the Project Application is approved. \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n21 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \n•  Submission of Final Project Plans, Specifications, and Cost Estimate (if required): \nSix (6) months from the date the Project Application is approved. \nProjects that fail to meet the established timeline (including extensions, if any) are subject to \ncancellation and reallocation of funds.  \nii) \nEXCESS FUNDS \nAs noted above, excess funds are funds that OCD determines are available for reallocation. OCD will \nundertake periodic assessments to identify excess funds. OCD will calculate excess funds as the \ndifference between  \n•  The funds currently allocated to the program, project, or subrecipient, as applicable, and  \n•  The projected amount of expenditures by OCD or the subrecipient that will occur prior to the HUD \nexpenditure deadline. \nOCD may reduce or decline to make an excess funds determination if OCD determines that the amount \nof excess funds was the result of exigent circumstances, such as a natural disaster.  \nOCD will notify the subrecipient in writing upon determining that any part of an award or allocation \nconstitutes excess funds.  \niii)  REALLOCATED FUNDS  \nWhen reallocating “excess funds”, the primary reallocation priorities are as follows: \n•  Relocate funds to programs, activities or subrecipients that are likely to expend the CDBG-DR \nfunds prior to the HUD expenditure deadline with a focus on addressing unmet housing needs. \n•  Relocate funds to programs, activities, or subrecipients that are likely to expend the CDBG-DR \nfunds prior to the HUD expenditure deadline to address other unmet needs. \nD.  RECAPTURE OF FUNDS \n1.  OCD is responsible for ensuring that CDBG-DR funds awarded under the RCIP comply with all \nfederal, state, and local requirements. To ensure subrecipients receiving CDBG-DR assistance are \nusing the funds for their intended purpose, OCD requires all subrecipients to execute a CEA\nstipulating each party’s responsibilities and the potential penalties if the subrecipient is found not to \nhave fulfilled their obligations. The subrecipient must return to OCD all CDBG-DR funds utilized for \npayment which OCD or HUD determines to have been ineligible expenditures, no matter the cause \n(e.g., the particular cost is determined to be ineligible or unreasonable, prohibited because of \nduplicative sources, or the project does not timely meet its national objective or proposed eligible \nactivity). \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n22 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \n2.  Throughout a project’s lifecycle, continual steps will be undertaken by OCD staff to monitor for and \naddress subrecipient compliance concerns. These steps provide the subrecipients an opportunity to \navoid the actions or adequately rectify the actions that could lead to recapture. \n3.  Subrecipients are at risk for the recapture of previously paid CDBG-DR grant funds if OCD identifies \nnon-compliance with OCD policies and/or CDBG-DR regulations. Examples of non-compliance \ninclude but are not limited to: \na.  Ineligibility of previously reimbursed item(s); \nb.  Subrecipient substantial non-compliance including issues related to Davis-Bacon, environmental \nreview, mismanagement of funds on an individual project basis, across projects, or on a \nsubrecipient level; \nc. \nImproper procurement or contract management; \nd.  Failure to Obtain and maintain flood insurance; \ne.  Noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the CEA; \nf.  Failure to meet a national objective or HUD eligible activity; \ng.  Missing or late submittal of Single Audits; \nh.  Results from a HUD Office of Inspector General audit; \ni. \nIdentification of a Duplication of Benefits (DOB) compliance issue; \nj.  Subrecipient fraud, waste, or abuse on an individual project basis, across projects or on a \nsubrecipient level; and \nk.  Subrecipient voluntary or involuntary withdrawal from a project leading to lack of project \ncompletion. \n4.  Funds to be recaptured are identified at a project level, not across multiple projects, should a \nsubrecipient have multiple active projects at one time. \n5.  Should a subrecipient with multiple active projects be in “recapture” due to a concern that impacts \nall or multiple projects, OCD may withhold all payments on the subrecipient’s active projects in \nquestion until recapture proceedings are complete. \n6.  The amount of money identified for recapture will be the minimum amount of money OCD believes \nis non-compliant and/or at risk of recapture from HUD. \nE.  CANCELING A PROJECT \n1.  Projects that will not complete an eligible activity and/or meet the national objective within the RCIP \ndeadlines must be canceled if: \n•  Funds have been disbursed to the subrecipient; or \n•  The application for funding has been approved by OCD. \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n23 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \n2.  A change in subrecipient or dropping of a project component is not a canceled project. Changes \nsuch as a subrecipient switch or the dropping of a project component are memorialized through the \ncontrolling document at any given stage, such as an amendment to the CEA. \n3.  A subrecipient may work with OCD to cancel a project for the following reasons:  \n•  Findings from the environmental review; \n•  Lack of cost reasonableness; \n•  Not feasible; \n•  Costs of other projects; \n• \nIneligibility; \n•  Lack of support for the project by property owners/beneficiaries; or \n•  Subrecipient or contractor’s failure to comply with OCD policy and procedure. \n4.  In order to minimize the amount of funds expended on a project that will not be implemented, \nprojects that run into any of these barriers should be canceled as soon as it has become apparent \nthat the subrecipient is no longer able to complete the project within the CDBG-DR grant deadlines. \nIt is at OCD’s discretion to reprogram any funds from canceled projects. OCD will work with \nsubrecipients to review projects for feasibility to meet the deadlines to help ensure projects that \nproceed will not be at risk of cancellation. \n5.  Subrecipients will be deemed unresponsive:  \na.  When a subrecipient is unresponsive or unwilling to advance a project it has agreed to advance, \nOCD may cancel the project. \nb.  The unresponsive subrecipient will be given two (2) notification attempts to respond to OCD and \nafforded an opportunity to document why the project has not advanced and provide a time \nschedule as to when the subrecipient will advance the project before the project is canceled. \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n24 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \n', metadata={'heading': 'V.

The \nHUD environmental review process must be completed before any funds may be committed for \nprogram-eligible activities. No work may start on a proposed project before the environmental review \nprocess is completed, even if that work is being done using non-HUD funds.

A violation of this requirement may \njeopardize federal funding to this project and disallow all costs that were incurred before the completion \nof the Environmental Review. \nThe primary objectives of the HUD environmental review are to identify specific environmental factors \nthat may be encountered at potential project sites and to develop procedures to ensure compliance with \nregulations pertaining to these factors. The HUD environmental review is designed to produce program-\nspecific environmental review procedures in a program that can vary greatly in terms of scope of work. \nLaws and regulations which contain environmental provisions that must be complied with include: \n•  Noise  \n•  Historic Properties  \n•  Coastal Zones  \n•  Environmental Justice  \n•  Floodplains \n•  Wetlands  \n•  Manmade Hazards  \n•  Water Quality  \n•  Air Quality  \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n25 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \n•  Endangered Species  \n•  Farmland Protection \nThe procedures for securing environmental clearance are stipulated in the Disaster Recovery CDBG \nGrantee Administrative Manual (Administrative Manual) located on the OCD website at \nhttps://www.doa.la.gov/doa/ocd/policy-and-reports/administrative-manual/. \nIt is important to emphasize that no choice limiting actions, including the acquisition of property \nor easements necessary for a project, can be taken until the completion of the environmental \nreview.

These percentages were derived using a formula that \nincorporates FEMA Public Assistance and Individual Assistance as of August 21, 2022, including \ndistributing State PA to the appropriate parishes. They are intended to provide best estimates of \ninfrastructure and economic revitalization needs as determined by losses due to the hurricanes and \nflooding.    \nHousing damage as quantified in the IA dataset, along with obligated PA provide the best, most \nconsistent estimates of unmet needs in the infrastructure and economic development areas, and \nprovide a level of consistency that could be applied fairly across most impacted areas.  \nObligated PA provides direct funding for damaged infrastructure and better represents actual \ninfrastructure damage. Most of the money allocated through this process will be spent on the recovery \nof infrastructure, so weighting PA more heavily is appropriate when considering the purpose of the \nfunds. The reasons it makes sense to leave housing damages in the calculation are as follows:  \n•  While housing and obligated PA both provide a good indicator of total damage, weighting PA more \nheavily tends to favor parishes that are struggling the most with recovery. The housing damage is \nprobably more consistent and adds consideration for those parishes that are more residential and \nless commercially based. \n•  Housing damage provides a good proxy for overall damage, whereas obligated C-G PA money \nprovides a good proxy for infrastructure specific damage.  \n•  The inclusion of housing damage also helps smooth out any differences in the quality of project \nworksheets submitted.  \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A / D E L T A \nH U R R I C A N E   I D A / M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S \nHUD MID\nAcadia Parish \n(70526/70578) \nAllen Parish \nBeauregard Parish \nCaddo Parish \nWEIGHTED \nAVERAGE OF FEMA \nPA (2/3) AND IA (1/3)\nHUD MID\nWEIGHTED \nAVERAGE OF FEMA \nPA (2/3) AND IA (1/3)\n0.80% \n2.00% \n2.80% \n0.60% \nAscension Parish \nAssumption Parish \nCalcasieu Parish \n1.00% \n0.80% \n0.50% \nEast Baton Rouge Parish \n1.30% \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n39 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \n', metadata={'heading': 'E-1\n', 'content_font': 20, 'heading_font': 24, 'source': '.spyder-py3\\RCIP.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Calcasieu Parish \n(including City of Lake \nCharles) \n70.30% \nIberville Parish \n(70764/70788) \nCameron Parish \n11.00% \nJefferson Parish \nJefferson Davis Parish \n1.70% \nLafayette Parish \nNatchitoches Parish \nOuachita Parish \nRapides Parish \n1.40% \n0.70% \n0.80% \n2.90% \nSt. Landry Parish (70570)  0.50% \nSt. Martin Parish (70517) \n0.20% \nVermilion Parish (70510) \n3.90% \nVernon Parish (71446) \n0.60% \nLafourche Parish \nLivingston Parish \nOrleans Parish \nPlaquemines Parish \nSt. Bernard Parish \nSt. Charles Parish \nSt. Helena Parish \nSt. James Parish \nSt. John the Baptist \nParish \nGrand Total \n100.00% \nSt. Mary Parish \nSt. Tammany Parish \nTangipahoa Parish \nTerrebonne Parish \nWashington Parish \n0.30% \n23.40% \n11.90% \n1.40% \n9.10% \n1.40% \n0.30% \n3.00% \n0.20% \n1.20% \n5.30% \n0.20% \n1.90% \n4.30% \n32.20% \n0.20% \nWest Baton Rouge Parish \n(70767) \n0.03% \nGrand Total \n100.00% \n', metadata={'heading': 'E-1\n', 'content_font': 11, 'heading_font': 24, 'source': '.spyder-py3\\RCIP.pdf'}), Document(page_content='•  OCD obtained the total FEMA Individual Assistance and Public Assistance damages and calculated \nas a percent of total.

Regardless of which eligible activity and national objective, each project will serve \neither an area or direct benefit. The purpose of this document is to be an instructional tool for mapping \nproject service areas. This document will also serve as a guide to complete the beneficiary forms in \nOCD’s IGX applications. \nIn general, the mapping and beneficiary documentation process is as follows: \n•  Determine the project service area. \n•  Use the HUD Low- and Moderate-Income Summary Map Application to determine the project’s \nnational objective (Urgent Need or LMI). \n•  Enter data in the appropriate fields in the Benefiting Area form, Project Beneficiaries form, and the \nArea Benefit form in the project application in OCD’s IGX system. \n•  Upload maps and other documentation where applicable in the project application (or project \namendment when needed) in OCD’s IGX system. \nDETERMINING SERVICE AREA \nThe service area must be the full range of direct effects of the proposed project activity. The boundaries \nof the activities may or may not coincide with census or other geographic boundaries, especially in \nsmaller communities and rural areas where block groups or census tracts with low population cover \nlarge geographic areas. Factors to be considered in defining the service area include the nature of the \nactivity, location of the activity, accessibility issues, and availability of comparable activities. Service \nareas should be based on the intended beneficiaries of the project. Service areas must not be modified \nif substantial numbers show a principle benefit to non-LMI persons. \nSome activity types have a pre-determined service area for other purposes. Perhaps most notable \namong these activities are police precincts, fire stations, and schools. In each case, specific boundaries \nhave already been determined so that the persons involved know which facility serves persons or \nproperties located at a particular address within the community. Generally speaking, if the service area \nhas the same boundary with a parish, incorporated city or census designated place, the subrecipient \nshould use the HUD Low and Moderate Income Summary Data (LMISD) Local Government Summaries \nto extract the corresponding low and moderate income population data. \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n52 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \n', metadata={'heading': 'E-5\n', 'content_font': 20, 'heading_font': 24, 'source': '.spyder-py3\\RCIP.pdf'}), Document(page_content='It is reasonable to assume that certain kinds of facilities serve only very small areas.

As described in CPD Notice 19-02 and CPD Notice 14-013, the entirety of the data for all block \ngroups which the service area both completely encloses and partially overlaps must be used. \nIf the service area does not reasonably correspond to any available LMISD geographies, the \nsubrecipient may consider conducting a methodologically-sound local income survey to determine LMA \ncompliance.

A sub-division of a census tract (or, prior to 2000, a block numbering \narea), a block group is a cluster of blocks having the same first digit of their four-digit identifying number \nwithin a census tract. \nBoundary - The extent or limit of a geographic area such as a block, census tract, parish, or place. A \nboundary may or may not follow a visible geographic physical feature and may be legal or statistical. \nCensus - A complete enumeration, usually of a population, but also of businesses and commercial \nestablishments, housing, farms, governments, and so forth. \nCensus Block - A statistical area bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and \nrailroad tracks, and by nonvisible boundaries, such as selected property lines and city, township, school \ndistricts, and parish boundaries. \nA block is the smallest geographic unit for which the Census Bureau tabulates decennial census data. \nMany blocks correspond to individual city blocks bounded by streets, but blocks – especially in rural \nareas – may include many square miles and may have some boundaries that are not streets. The \nCensus Bureau established blocks covering the entire nation for the first time in 1990. Previous \ncensuses back to 1940 had blocks established only for part of the nation. Over 8 million blocks were \nidentified for Census 2000 and over 11 million blocks were identified for the 2010 Census. \nCensus Tract - A small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a parish delineated by a local \ncommittee of census data users for the purpose of presenting data. Census tracts nest within counties, \nand their boundaries normally follow visible features, but may follow legal geography boundaries and \nother non-visible features in some instances. Census tracts ideally contain about 4,000 people and \n1,600 housing units \nCity - The smallest administrative unit of a parish having a predominately urban population. \nCity Block - Blocks are typically bounded by streets. In cities, a census block may correspond to a city \nblock, but in rural areas where there are fewer roads, blocks may be defined by other features. \nData - Refers to factual information about people and businesses collected in censuses and surveys \nand through administrative records (e.g., birth certificates) and the results released based on these \ndata collections. A more precise definition makes a distinction between “data” (facts collected before \nprocessing) and “information” (facts processed, sorted, and released in tables or as microdata). \nH U R R I C A N E S   L A U R A   ( D R 4 5 5 9 ) ,   D E L T A   ( D R 4 5 7 0 ) ,   I D A   ( D R 4 6 1 1 )   A N D   M A Y   2 0 2 1   S E V E R E   S T O R M S   ( D R 4 6 0 6 )  \n75 \nR E S I L I E N T   C O M M U N I T I E S   I N F R A S T R U C T U R E   P R O G A M   P O L I C Y   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   M A N U A L  \n', metadata={'heading': 'E-5\n', 'content_font': 15, 'heading_font': 24, 'source': '.spyder-py3\\RCIP.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Data Set - Refers to the assembled results of one data collection operation (for example, the results of \nthe 2010 Census or the 2012 Economic Census) as a whole or in major subsets (for example, 2010 \nCensus Summary File 1 or the 2007 Survey of Business Owners). The dataset may include statistics, \ngraphs, maps, microdata, printed reports, and results in other forms. \nIncorporated Area - A type of governmental unit incorporated under state law having legally \nprescribed powers and functions. Types of incorporated places include cities, towns (except the New \nEngland states, New York, and Wisconsin), boroughs (except in Alaska and New York), and villages. \nHawaii and Guam do not contain any incorporated places. \nSurvey - A data collection activity involving observation or questionnaires for a sample of a population. \n(A census is a 100-percent sample survey; it collects information about every member of a population.) \nSurveys are normally less expensive to conduct than censuses; hence, they may be taken more \nfrequently and can provide an information update between censuses. Often, they are used to collect a \nwider variety of information than is collected in a census. \nUnincorporated Area - An unincorporated area is a region of land that is not governed by a local \nmunicipal corporation; similarly, an unincorporated community is a settlement that is not governed by its \nown local municipal corporation, but rather is administered as part of larger administrative divisions, \nsuch as a township, parish, borough, village, city, canton, state, province or country. Occasionally, \nmunicipalities dissolve which may happen if they become fiscally insolvent.
