      "OCD will notify the subrecipient in writing upon determining that any part of an award or allocation\n",
      "constitutes excess funds.\n",
      "iii) REALLOCATED FUNDS\n",
      "When reallocating “excess funds”, the primary reallocation priorities are as follows:\n",
      "• Relocate funds to programs, activities or subrecipients that are likely to expend the CDBG-DR\n",

      "(e.g., the particular cost is determined to be ineligible or unreasonable, prohibited because of\n",

      "2. Throughout a project’s lifecycle, continual steps will be undertaken by OCD staff to monitor for and\n",
      "address subrecipient compliance concerns. These steps provide the subrecipients an opportunity to\n",
      "avoid the actions or adequately rectify the actions that could lead to recapture.\n",
      "3. Subrecipients are at risk for the recapture of previously paid CDBG-DR grant funds if OCD identifies\n",
      "non-compliance with OCD policies and/or CDBG-DR regulations. Examples of non-compliance\n",
      "include but are not limited to:\n",
      "a. Ineligibility of previously reimbursed item(s);\n",

      "E. CANCELING A PROJECT\n",
      "1. Projects that will not complete an eligible activity and/or meet the national objective within the RCIP\n",

      "• The application for funding has been approved by OCD.\n",

      "such as a subrecipient switch or the dropping of a project component are memorialized through the\n",
      "controlling document at any given stage, such as an amendment to the CEA.\n",
      "3. A subrecipient may work with OCD to cancel a project for the following reasons:\n",

      "• Costs of other projects;\n",

      "• Lack of support for the project by property owners/beneficiaries; or\n",
      "• Subrecipient or contractor’s failure to comply with OCD policy and procedure.\n",
      "4. In order to minimize the amount of funds expended on a project that will not be implemented,\n",
      "projects that run into any of these barriers should be canceled as soon as it has become apparent\n",
      "that the subrecipient is no longer able to complete the project within the CDBG-DR grant deadlines.\n",
      "It is at OCD’s discretion to reprogram any funds from canceled projects. OCD will work with\n",

      "5. Subrecipients will be deemed unresponsive:\n",
      "a. When a subrecipient is unresponsive or unwilling to advance a project it has agreed to advance,\n",
      "OCD may cancel the project.\n",
      "b. The unresponsive subrecipient will be given two (2) notification attempts to respond to OCD and\n",

      "OCD’s IGX applications.\n",
      "In general, the mapping and beneficiary documentation process is as follows:\n",

      "• Use the HUD Low- and Moderate-Income Summary Map Application to determine the project’s\n",
