Go through each section of the proposal document, including sections A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, and tell me if each section meets the requirements. Describe why or why not each section meets the requirements. Specifically, first print the original section, then give your description of why or why not this section meets the requirements. If there are requirements that are not touched on in the proposal document, make note of that at the end of your output. If tabular data in the proposal document is important, check that against the requirements too.
